# Antisyphon Training VM Fix Menu

This project contains scripts created to fix problems inside the Antisyphon Training Lab VM.

# Getting Started

*MAKE SURE THIS IS DONE IN THE VM*

Follow the instructions on the PDF guide from Antisyphon Discord! Make sure you run PowerShell as admin!

#Fixes

1. Disable Automatic Updates for both Store and Windows Updates
2. Fix Hashcat lab which downloads a newer version of Intel OpenCL to resolve the CL_DEVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE error



That's all! Now your VM should not install Store or Windows updates!
